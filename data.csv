51,c04-170-04.jpg,Britain was slipping behind ... .
52,c06-011-00.jpg,ALSO present is a London journalist who
53,c06-011-01.jpg,arrived two hours earlier by appointment
54,c06-011-02.jpg,to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
55,c06-011-03.jpg,"The Hostage about his new work , if any ,"
56,c06-011-04.jpg,and who is now being pluckily convivial
57,c06-011-05.jpg,to fight off the frustration . The telephone
58,c06-011-06.jpg,"has rung a couple of times , calls from"
59,c06-011-07.jpg,other chums sniffing the wind and
60,c06-011-08.jpg,offering to drop by for a chat .
61,d01-016-00.jpg,The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
62,d01-016-01.jpg,the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
63,d01-016-02.jpg,"plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote ."
64,d01-016-03.jpg,The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
65,d01-019-00.jpg,There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
66,d01-019-01.jpg,Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The
67,d01-019-02.jpg,present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The
68,d01-019-03.jpg,"original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was"
69,d01-019-04.jpg,"accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he"
70,d01-019-05.jpg,"could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order ."
71,d01-049-00.jpg,The one real weakness of the Commentator's
72,d01-049-01.jpg,"case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,"
73,d01-049-02.jpg,"he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly"
74,d01-049-03.jpg,how this enlargement was effected nor has he
75,d01-049-04.jpg,been able to explain the textual movements by
76,d01-049-05.jpg,showing that such changes are part of a
77,d01-049-06.jpg,simple and coherent plan . To understand how
78,d01-049-07.jpg,this is possible it is necessary to examine the
79,d01-049-08.jpg,text of the Gospel .
80,d01-052-00.jpg,THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
81,d01-052-01.jpg,written in Greek . A modern text of the
82,d01-052-02.jpg,Gospel represents the work of generations of
83,d01-052-03.jpg,scholars who have compared the many manu-
84,d01-052-04.jpg,scripts of John and worked out the version
85,d01-052-05.jpg,which is most likely to have been the original
86,d01-052-06.jpg,wording . It is not possible to establish any one
87,d01-052-07.jpg,text with absolute precision .
88,d01-080-00.jpg,"The bar was the commonest marking , but others"
89,d01-080-01.jpg,were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
90,d01-080-02.jpg,"bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as"
91,d01-080-03.jpg,it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
92,d01-080-04.jpg,paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
93,d01-080-05.jpg,the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
94,d01-080-06.jpg,"some markings would be used , although which , it is"
95,d01-080-07.jpg,impossible to say .
96,d01-085-00.jpg,Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
97,d01-085-01.jpg,the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
98,d01-085-02.jpg,"original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,"
99,d01-085-03.jpg,"whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in"
100,d01-085-04.jpg,columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
101,d01-085-05.jpg,manuscripts . A common size of column would hold
102,d01-085-06.jpg,about one third of a page of Souter's print .
103,d01-098-00.jpg,The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
104,d01-098-01.jpg,and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
105,d01-098-02.jpg,a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
106,d01-098-03.jpg,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
107,d01-098-04.jpg,this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
108,d01-098-05.jpg,"was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not"
109,d01-098-06.jpg,an easy form of book in which to find a
110,d01-098-07.jpg,reference .
111,d01-104-00.jpg,This last objection might have had some weight in
112,d01-104-01.jpg,"ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,"
113,d01-104-02.jpg,the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
114,d01-104-03.jpg,As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
115,d01-104-04.jpg,"overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his"
116,d01-104-05.jpg,information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
117,d01-104-06.jpg,The other form of book was the codex . In this the
118,d01-104-07.jpg,sheets were bound together down one edge much as
119,d01-104-08.jpg,they are in modern books .
120,d01-118-00.jpg,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
121,d01-118-01.jpg,might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
122,d01-118-02.jpg,whether or not a particular text was written on
123,d01-118-03.jpg,a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
124,d01-118-04.jpg,"writing , but any papyrus left unused at the"
125,d01-118-05.jpg,end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
126,d01-118-06.jpg,"the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on ."
127,d01-123-00.jpg,"The verso of the roll was blank , and one"
128,d01-123-01.jpg,"cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,"
129,d01-123-02.jpg,"sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,"
130,d01-123-03.jpg,while one whole side of his roll was unused .
131,d01-123-04.jpg,The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
132,d01-123-05.jpg,"in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra"
133,d01-123-06.jpg,sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
134,d01-123-07.jpg,"over the binding , or the whole codex rebound ."
135,d03-117-00.jpg,A natural transition from gardens and
136,d03-117-01.jpg,orchards to the vital question of water
137,d03-117-02.jpg,supply . The pools are probably natural springs
138,d03-117-03.jpg,enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
139,d03-117-04.jpg,the rock . King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
140,d03-117-05.jpg,"construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone ,"
141,d03-117-06.jpg,which read : And I built Baal-meon and made
142,d03-117-07.jpg,in it the reservoir ... and I made both the
143,d03-117-08.jpg,reservoirs for water inside the town .
144,d04-012-00.jpg,The word Shamir was used as a
145,d04-012-01.jpg,personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
146,d04-012-02.jpg,"word "" SHAMIR "" means guarded or preser-"
147,d04-012-03.jpg,"ved . Therefore , the real man , who"
148,d04-012-04.jpg,"regards himself as insignificant , as the"
149,d04-012-05.jpg,"prayer says : "" What am I ? A worm "" , he"
150,d04-012-06.jpg,is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
151,d04-012-07.jpg,"the Shmah , loves the Lord God with"
152,d04-012-08.jpg,"all his heart , and with all his soul and"
153,d04-012-09.jpg,with all his might and studies the
154,d04-012-10.jpg,word of God .
155,d04-016-00.jpg,"This man is the worm , the creature that"
156,d04-016-01.jpg,cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such
157,d04-016-02.jpg,a man is the Shamir that guards him-
158,d04-016-03.jpg,self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
159,d04-016-04.jpg,Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
160,d04-016-05.jpg,"to mould our character , to melt our"
161,d04-016-06.jpg,heart of stone . This Shamir helps
162,d04-016-07.jpg,us earthly creatures to build an Altar
163,d04-016-08.jpg,for God to come nearer to God .
164,d04-021-00.jpg,The action of the Shamir writes books and their
165,d04-021-01.jpg,books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare
166,d04-021-02.jpg,"diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest"
167,d04-021-03.jpg,facts . And these creatures existed from the
168,d04-021-04.jpg,"beginning . It is "" the stone , which the builders"
169,d04-021-05.jpg,"refused , but it is to become the head-stone"
170,d04-021-06.jpg,"of the corner "" . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall"
171,d04-021-07.jpg,tell !
172,d04-028-00.jpg,""" For the stone shall cry out of the wall "" , like"
173,d04-028-01.jpg,"Baalam's ass , "" and the purlin of timber shall"
174,d04-028-02.jpg,"creak in answer "" "" if the roof of our security is"
175,d04-028-03.jpg,"crushing our soul "" ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) . And it is"
176,d04-028-04.jpg,"through the Shamir : "" That the earth shall be"
177,d04-028-05.jpg,filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
178,d04-028-06.jpg,"Lord , as the waters cover the sea . "" ( Hab. 2 , 14 . )"
179,d04-032-00.jpg,"The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue ,"
180,d04-032-01.jpg,"which is written on two plates , the hard facts"
181,d04-032-02.jpg,"of life , and all facts are "" one "" . We have all"
182,d04-032-03.jpg,come across human Shamirs and they leave
183,d04-032-04.jpg,a deep impression on our feelings and senses .
184,d04-032-05.jpg,They make us the Altar for God to emit
185,d04-032-06.jpg,the Light which can be read in every
186,d04-032-07.jpg,"language . The Shamir is the "" seventh "" and"
187,d04-032-08.jpg,"most important creature , that was created on"
188,d04-032-09.jpg,"the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the"
189,d04-032-10.jpg,"Sabbath , real peace to the whole world ."
190,d04-037-00.jpg,"Then the whole earth will be His Altar . "" And it"
191,d04-037-01.jpg,"shall come to pass , if 1ye shall 1hearken"
192,d04-037-02.jpg,"diligently unto my commandments , which I command"
193,d04-037-03.jpg,"you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to"

297,d04-131-05.jpg,"eating Matzos in Egypt and the "" Feast of Matzos """
298,d04-131-06.jpg,was known even to Abraham and Lot .
299,d05-008-00.jpg,The new century opened with James 1 ascending
300,d05-008-01.jpg,the throne . He was quite prepared to be
301,d05-008-02.jpg,tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
302,d05-008-03.jpg,"spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for"
303,d05-008-04.jpg,"James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,"
304,d05-008-05.jpg,"but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer"
305,d05-008-06.jpg,Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
306,d05-008-07.jpg,derived little comfort from it .
307,d05-013-00.jpg,They objected to the word Absolution . So the phrase ' or
308,d05-013-01.jpg,the remission of sins ' was added . But Absolution remained .
309,d05-013-02.jpg,They objected to the word Confirmation . So the phrase
310,d05-013-03.jpg,' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
311,d05-013-04.jpg,able to render an account of their faith according
312,d05-013-05.jpg,to the Catechism following ' were added . But Confirmation
313,d05-013-06.jpg,remained . Other changes in the Book were equally
314,d05-013-07.jpg,minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
315,d05-013-08.jpg,added to the Catechism .
316,d05-021-00.jpg,This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
317,d05-021-01.jpg,"been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for"
318,d05-021-02.jpg,"it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are"
319,d05-021-03.jpg,verily and indeed taken and received by the
320,d05-021-04.jpg,faithful in the Lord's Supper . ' It could hardly be more
321,d05-021-05.jpg,"definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made"
322,d05-021-06.jpg,himself immortal by becoming associated with
323,d05-021-07.jpg,a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
324,d05-021-08.jpg,( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
325,d05-025-00.jpg,In that year Shakespeare had just turned
326,d05-025-01.jpg,forty and had written Hamlet two years
327,d05-025-02.jpg,before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
328,d05-025-03.jpg,just learning to read . James was followed by
329,d05-025-04.jpg,"Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish"
330,d05-025-05.jpg,Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
331,d05-025-06.jpg,a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
332,d05-025-07.jpg,became the foster mother of some of the most
333,d05-025-08.jpg,important Prayer Books in the Anglican
334,d05-025-09.jpg,Communion .
335,d05-030-00.jpg,"Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,"
336,d05-030-01.jpg,now so much nobler a figure than former historians
337,d05-030-02.jpg,led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
338,d05-030-03.jpg,"by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was"
339,d05-030-04.jpg,mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
340,d05-030-05.jpg,first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
341,d05-030-06.jpg,"the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly"
342,d05-030-07.jpg,"with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,"
343,d05-030-08.jpg,was necessarily a menace .
344,d05-040-00.jpg,Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ?
345,d05-040-01.jpg,Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase
346,d05-040-02.jpg,a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected
347,d05-040-03.jpg,and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be
348,d05-040-04.jpg,"altars and not any broken down , transportable"
349,d05-040-05.jpg,table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
350,d06-003-00.jpg,Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child
351,d06-003-01.jpg,"by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know"
352,d06-003-02.jpg,"that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,"
353,d06-003-03.jpg,but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting
354,d06-003-04.jpg,that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
355,d06-003-05.jpg,"to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the"
356,d06-003-06.jpg,other side as victors .
357,d06-008-00.jpg,To ridicule them only pushes them farther
358,d06-008-01.jpg,"into themselves , so that they become"
359,d06-008-02.jpg,unable to speak about it to anybody and
360,d06-008-03.jpg,"the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,"
361,d06-008-04.jpg,the harvest of which may still be being
362,d06-008-05.jpg,reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to
363,d06-008-06.jpg,agree with a child that a particular
364,d06-008-07.jpg,"situation is frightening , and then to face"
365,d06-008-08.jpg,it together until the child can see how
366,d06-008-09.jpg,unnecessary its fears were .
367,d06-011-00.jpg,Because situations which may contain
368,d06-011-01.jpg,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,"
369,d06-011-02.jpg,it is a good idea to condition a child
370,d06-011-03.jpg,to some extent against it . To keep a child
371,d06-011-04.jpg,of twelve or thirteen under the
372,d06-011-05.jpg,impression that nothing nasty ever
373,d06-011-06.jpg,"happens is not merely dishonest , it"
374,d06-011-07.jpg,is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
375,d06-011-08.jpg,later chapter there are some situations
376,d06-011-09.jpg,which occur less frequently than
377,d06-020-00.jpg,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
378,d06-020-01.jpg,should pass from Him . Jesus shows us
379,d06-020-02.jpg,the way to face life . To see all the latent
380,d06-020-03.jpg,frightening possibilities and yet by facing
381,d06-020-04.jpg,them and knowing God is with us and
382,d06-020-05.jpg,"that , with Him , there is nothing that can"
383,d06-020-06.jpg,"finally defeat us . More than that , that God"
384,d06-020-07.jpg,has something important to do with our
385,d06-020-08.jpg,"lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,"
386,d06-020-09.jpg,the stronger we become .
387,d06-025-00.jpg,... Today A wonderful thought In the
388,d06-025-01.jpg,dawn was given ... And the thought
389,d06-025-02.jpg,Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
390,d06-025-03.jpg,"my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,"
391,d06-025-04.jpg,"Because of the plan That God , Who"
392,d06-025-05.jpg,"dwells in my hand , Knows this"
393,d06-025-06.jpg,"secret plan , Of the things He will"
394,d06-025-07.jpg,do for the world Using my hand .
395,d06-027-00.jpg,"Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced"
396,d06-027-01.jpg,"all human emotion , and whose sensitive"
397,d06-027-02.jpg,"nature knows better than we do , what it is to"
398,d06-027-03.jpg,"be really afraid , help us to know that when"
399,d06-027-04.jpg,"we face life boldly , many of the shadows are"
400,d06-027-05.jpg,"seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,"
401,d06-027-06.jpg,"come what may , we are never alone when"
402,d06-027-07.jpg,we are with Thee .
403,d06-037-00.jpg,"To others , the long hours of the night bring"
404,d06-037-01.jpg,only a disturbed tossing and turning
405,d06-037-02.jpg,which causes them to wake feeling worse
406,d06-037-03.jpg,than when they went to bed . We may begin
407,d06-037-04.jpg,to understand this a little better when we
408,d06-037-05.jpg,realize that tiredness itself is largely in
409,d06-037-06.jpg,"the mind . Very few people , under normal"
410,d06-037-07.jpg,"conditions , work themselves to a standstill ."
411,d06-041-00.jpg,The mind tires first and conveys the impression
412,d06-041-01.jpg,of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by
413,d06-041-02.jpg,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
414,d06-041-03.jpg,body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose
415,d06-041-04.jpg,a mother has news late at night that her
416,d06-041-05.jpg,child is in danger . She will undertake a
417,d06-041-06.jpg,"journey which , an hour before , she would"
418,d06-041-07.jpg,have declared impossible .
419,d06-046-00.jpg,"Even more simply , test your own reactions"
420,d06-046-01.jpg,to different situations . There are some which
421,d06-046-02.jpg,bring on an almost immediate feeling of
422,d06-046-03.jpg,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
423,d06-046-04.jpg,"the washing-up - while others , if they"
424,d06-046-05.jpg,"refer to something you like doing , bring a"
425,d06-046-06.jpg,veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who
426,d06-046-07.jpg,is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
427,d06-046-08.jpg,up with no apparent tiredness at all when
428,d06-046-09.jpg,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
429,d06-056-00.jpg,They drag themselves around and can become
430,d06-056-01.jpg,a burden to their families and their friends .
431,d06-056-02.jpg,Any mental confusion can cause this and
432,d06-056-03.jpg,the best way is probably to seek advice .
433,d06-056-04.jpg,As we are unable to cure our own bodies
434,d06-056-05.jpg,"if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,"
435,d06-056-06.jpg,"so we are unable to cure our own minds ,"
436,d06-056-07.jpg,if the trouble is a complicated one
437,d06-056-08.jpg,involving careful and patient treatment .
438,d06-060-00.jpg,One of the greatest steps forward that has been
439,d06-060-01.jpg,made this century is the way in which illness
440,d06-060-02.jpg,"of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,"
441,d06-060-03.jpg,and is in fact no differently regarded than
442,d06-060-04.jpg,"physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a"
443,d06-060-05.jpg,great deal of tiredness which comes from
444,d06-060-06.jpg,no major complication but results from an
445,d06-060-07.jpg,"inability to deal with life , especially under"
446,d06-060-08.jpg,the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
447,d06-060-09.jpg,century .
448,d06-063-00.jpg,"In the days when most people were born ,"
449,d06-063-01.jpg,lived and died within the boundaries of
450,d06-063-02.jpg,"the village , it was not difficult for anybody"
451,d06-063-03.jpg,to live a day at a time . Even those who
452,d06-063-04.jpg,held a high and responsible office lived in
453,d06-063-05.jpg,far greater simplicity than their successors .
454,d06-063-06.jpg,"When news from the Continent took days ,"
455,d06-063-07.jpg,"from America weeks , from the Far East ,"
456,d06-063-08.jpg,"months , even a Prime Minister could go to"
457,d06-063-09.jpg,sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
458,d06-063-10.jpg,"be happening at the other end of England ,"
459,d06-067-00.jpg,"In other ways , too , life for the ordinary"
460,d06-067-01.jpg,individual has become so complex
461,d06-067-02.jpg,that it taxes the mind . Two hundred
462,d06-067-03.jpg,"years ago , men lived and worked"
463,d06-067-04.jpg,"in one place , their lives were of one"
464,d06-067-05.jpg,"piece . Now a man may live twenty ,"
465,d06-067-06.jpg,thirty even sixty miles from his
466,d06-067-07.jpg,work . The only connexion is the
467,d06-067-08.jpg,pipeline of the railway on which they
468,d06-067-09.jpg,travel day by day .
469,d06-072-00.jpg,"In many cases , their homes know little of"
470,d06-072-01.jpg,their place of work and their associates at
471,d06-072-02.jpg,the office or works wonder what they
472,d06-072-03.jpg,are possibly like in the surroundings of their
473,d06-072-04.jpg,"homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead"
474,d06-072-05.jpg,a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
475,d06-072-06.jpg,planning to do so or in fact being conscious
476,d06-072-07.jpg,of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
477,d06-072-08.jpg,"compartments but over the years it builds up ,"
478,d06-072-09.jpg,and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
479,d06-072-10.jpg,need to be handled correctly .
480,d06-076-00.jpg,Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
481,d06-076-01.jpg,"as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-"
482,d06-076-02.jpg,necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness .
483,d06-076-03.jpg,We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time
484,d06-076-04.jpg,after time we forget something and have to go back
485,d06-076-05.jpg,upstairs or down to the shops .
486,d06-086-00.jpg,The housewife would find life far less tiring
487,d06-086-01.jpg,"if she made a list , followed a routine of work"
488,d06-086-02.jpg,rather than getting from one thing to the next .
489,d06-086-03.jpg,The business man would find that he reached
490,d06-086-04.jpg,the end of the day with far less strain if
491,d06-086-05.jpg,he was a little more systematic . To drift
492,d06-086-06.jpg,aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
493,d06-086-07.jpg,thing else . If we would only sit down and
494,d06-086-08.jpg,write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
495,d06-086-09.jpg,"be done and then work quietly through them ,"
496,d06-086-10.jpg,we would find life considerably less exhausting
497,d06-096-00.jpg,I am more than conscious of this . How anybody
498,d06-096-01.jpg,can go through the same routine day in and day
499,d06-096-02.jpg,out for forty years I find difficult to understand .
500,d06-096-03.jpg,A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
501,d06-096-04.jpg,commerce may be kept going - though if ever
502,d06-096-05.jpg,it becomes possible to work out a system
503,d06-096-06.jpg,of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense
504,d06-096-07.jpg,amount of good over and above relieving
505,d06-096-08.jpg,the pressure on over-crowded trains .
506,d06-100-00.jpg,"As it is , with so much of our life already"
507,d06-100-01.jpg,"in a predetermined groove , I would"
508,d06-100-02.jpg,hardly like to add further to the dullness
509,d06-100-03.jpg,which it engenders . But I am not arguing
510,d06-100-04.jpg,for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
511,d06-100-05.jpg,and I was interested some little while
512,d06-100-06.jpg,ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
513,d06-100-07.jpg,day timetable .
514,d06-104-00.jpg,"They only worked , of course , a five-"
515,d06-104-01.jpg,day week so that in the first week
516,d06-104-02.jpg,Monday to Friday were days one
517,d06-104-03.jpg,"to five of the timetable , the following"
518,d06-104-04.jpg,Monday was day six and Tuesday
519,d06-104-05.jpg,started day one again and so on .
520,d06-104-06.jpg,By this means they avoided each
521,d06-104-07.jpg,week being the same with a pupil
522,d06-104-08.jpg,knowing exactly what the subject
523,d06-104-09.jpg,would be on Friday afternoon at
524,d06-104-10.jpg,3 p.m. .
525,d06-107-00.jpg,"It was a little complicated to work ,"
526,d06-107-01.jpg,"of course , and there had to be a big"
527,d06-107-02.jpg,notice in the entrance saying which
528,d06-107-03.jpg,day of the timetable it was - but
529,d06-107-04.jpg,it added immensely to the interest
530,d06-107-05.jpg,and kept everybody on their toes .
531,d06-107-06.jpg,To have order does not mean getting
532,d06-107-07.jpg,into a dull routine . I have great
533,d06-107-08.jpg,sympathy with the young wife
534,d06-107-09.jpg,who does not always want to do
535,d06-107-10.jpg,the washing on a Monday .

537,d06-111-01.jpg,"the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to"
538,d06-111-02.jpg,sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to

546,d06-113-03.jpg,put all our energies into the particular
547,d06-113-04.jpg,matter on hand .
548,d07-082-00.jpg,"( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof"
549,d07-082-01.jpg,"texts and the Gemara explains why these ,"
550,d07-082-02.jpg,"too , are necessary , but a careful examination"
551,d07-082-03.jpg,of that passage makes it clear that these are
552,d07-082-04.jpg,not quoted here because they are not
553,d07-082-05.jpg,necessary to prove the point made by
554,d07-082-06.jpg,"R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that"
555,d07-082-07.jpg,the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
556,d07-082-08.jpg,elsewhere .
557,d07-085-00.jpg,"From the above it follows that here , once again ,"
558,d07-085-01.jpg,we have a good illustration of how a
559,d07-085-02.jpg,sugya has been fashioned from material
560,d07-085-03.jpg,already in the hands of the Redactors .
561,d07-085-04.jpg,The sugya is built around the saying of
562,d07-085-05.jpg,R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
563,d07-085-06.jpg,reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
564,d07-085-07.jpg,with the comment given by Samuel .
565,d07-089-00.jpg,( This is probably to be understood as a well-
566,d07-089-01.jpg,known comment on the verse ; quoted by
567,d07-089-02.jpg,Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
568,d07-089-03.jpg,by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
569,d07-089-04.jpg,Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by
570,d07-089-05.jpg,the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
571,d07-089-06.jpg,There is no reference to the Mishnah here
572,d07-089-07.jpg,because the Mishnah deals with the
573,d07-089-08.jpg,actual practice of greeting by the divine
574,d07-089-09.jpg,Name and the Gemara here quotes the
575,d07-089-10.jpg,texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
576,d07-093-00.jpg,The question and answer with regard to the
577,d07-093-01.jpg,need for the text of the angel are quoted
578,d07-093-02.jpg,here in the same words in which they are
579,d07-093-03.jpg,quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
580,d07-093-04.jpg,This can either mean that both sugyas are
581,d07-093-05.jpg,quoting a well-known question and
582,d07-093-06.jpg,answer or that our sugya is quoting from
583,d07-093-07.jpg,the longer sugya which deals with all
584,d07-093-08.jpg,four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
585,d07-096-00.jpg,Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
586,d07-096-01.jpg,original question and answer and this is quoted
587,d07-096-02.jpg,in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
588,d07-096-03.jpg,use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
589,d07-096-04.jpg,accord but there was no approval of his action
590,d07-096-05.jpg,in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an
591,d07-096-06.jpg,expression appears to have been framed in
592,d07-096-07.jpg,"response to the particular point at issue here ,"
593,d07-096-08.jpg,whether the Heavenly Court concurred
594,d07-096-09.jpg,in the decision of the human court . )
595,d07-100-00.jpg,The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
596,d07-100-01.jpg,is then quoted and the interpretation of the
597,d07-100-02.jpg,latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
598,d07-100-03.jpg,"is added , not because this is at all relevant"
599,d07-100-04.jpg,to the discussion but because it was
600,d07-100-05.jpg,a familiar interpretation which had
601,d07-100-06.jpg,become so well known that it was
602,d07-100-07.jpg,invariably quoted whenever the verse
603,d07-100-08.jpg,"itself was quoted , almost as if it were a"
604,d07-100-09.jpg,part of the verse .
605,d07-102-00.jpg,The Gemara continues with a saying of the
606,d07-102-01.jpg,"Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :"
607,d07-102-02.jpg,' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
608,d07-102-03.jpg,"the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,"
609,d07-102-04.jpg,and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
610,d07-102-05.jpg,"saying here is obvious , it follows naturally"
611,d07-102-06.jpg,on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
612,d07-102-07.jpg,deals with a similar theme .
613,e01-055-00.jpg,One can remember with horror the pictures of the
614,e01-055-01.jpg,overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
615,e01-055-02.jpg,"complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-"
616,e01-055-03.jpg,piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
617,e01-055-04.jpg,numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years
618,e01-055-05.jpg,after the Victorian period that designers realised
619,e01-055-06.jpg,"the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was"
620,e01-055-07.jpg,revived with designs suitable for contemporary
621,e01-055-08.jpg,"trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and"
622,e01-055-09.jpg,has even stepped into the field of high fashion .
623,e06-000-00.jpg,This could hardly happen without the
624,e06-000-01.jpg,herring having some orientation with the
625,e06-000-02.jpg,sea bottom . It means that the crowding
626,e06-000-03.jpg,"is caused during the daytime , and that"
627,e06-000-04.jpg,the herring must continue to migrate over
628,e06-000-05.jpg,the ground as well as in midwater and
629,e06-000-06.jpg,during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
630,e06-000-07.jpg,is always from the north ) .
631,e06-003-00.jpg,Thus we can see that herring
632,e06-003-01.jpg,"movements , although primarily"
633,e06-003-02.jpg,"instinctive perhaps , and certainly"
634,e06-003-03.jpg,"helped and hindered by water flow ,"
635,e06-003-04.jpg,are also closely related to the sea-bed
636,e06-003-05.jpg,"geography . Geography , too , names the"
637,e06-003-06.jpg,great fisheries that depend on them :
638,e06-003-07.jpg,the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
639,e06-003-08.jpg,"shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,"
640,e06-003-09.jpg,a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
641,e06-003-10.jpg,the herring spawn along the northern
642,e06-010-00.jpg,In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
643,e06-010-01.jpg,Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But
644,e06-010-02.jpg,"they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until"
645,e06-010-03.jpg,in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
646,e06-010-04.jpg,echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
647,e06-010-05.jpg,their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
648,e06-010-06.jpg,gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
649,e06-010-07.jpg,spawning herring are always found .
650,e06-015-00.jpg,The joint evidence of echo-sounders
651,e06-015-01.jpg,and fishing gear leads to an overall
652,e06-015-02.jpg,though somewhat dim picture .
653,e06-015-03.jpg,The details are harder still to see .
654,e06-015-04.jpg,"Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance ,"
655,e06-015-05.jpg,shoals that gather at the Knoll or
656,e06-015-06.jpg,other banks are most of them
657,e06-015-07.jpg,going to travel a hundred
658,e06-015-08.jpg,miles farther south before they
659,e06-015-09.jpg,spawn . Some will spawn at the
660,e06-021-00.jpg,So the arrival of any particular shoal
661,e06-021-01.jpg,fish at a certain spawning ground may
662,e06-021-02.jpg,be accidental . Yet there will always be some
663,e06-021-03.jpg,"that find it if enough are travelling , just as"
664,e06-021-04.jpg,the robin who gets back exactly may be
665,e06-021-05.jpg,only one among thousands who do not .
666,e06-021-06.jpg,But this southerly migration is not
667,e06-021-07.jpg,accidental . Being contranatant or against
668,e06-021-08.jpg,"the drift , it probably has a survival value"
669,e06-021-09.jpg,in ensuring that the fry after hatching
670,e06-021-10.jpg,are drifted back into the normal home
671,e06-026-00.jpg,Drift in another form probably
672,e06-026-01.jpg,explains how these migrating herring
673,e06-026-02.jpg,are biased to east or west by the
674,e06-026-03.jpg,different winds . Strong westerlies
675,e06-026-04.jpg,are well known to bring good
676,e06-026-05.jpg,longshore fishings . The surface
677,e06-026-06.jpg,water that is blown offshore must
678,e06-026-07.jpg,be replaced by an underflow bringing
679,e06-026-08.jpg,with it the herring to the Norfolk
680,e06-026-09.jpg,and Suffolk beaches .
681,e06-030-00.jpg,"Easterly winds , on the other hand ,"
682,e06-030-01.jpg,"mean no herring along the shore , as"
683,e06-030-02.jpg,recent years have shown . A succession
684,e06-030-03.jpg,of winds is needed for this effect of
685,e06-030-04.jpg,"course - one breeze will not do it ,"
686,e06-030-05.jpg,though a very hard westerly will
687,e06-030-06.jpg,"often start off the "" local "" herring ;"
688,e06-030-07.jpg,but quite apart from this wind effect
689,e06-030-08.jpg,there is an easterly drift special
690,e06-030-09.jpg,"to this rump of coastline , caused by"
691,e06-030-10.jpg,the meeting of water from north and south .
692,e06-033-00.jpg,"Herring fishermen call this "" the outset "" . It"
693,e06-033-01.jpg,"is strongest at spring tides , when without"
694,e06-033-02.jpg,"wind you will "" set "" out - or drift to the east-"
695,e06-033-03.jpg,"ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -"
696,e06-033-04.jpg,almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
697,e06-033-05.jpg,Knoll . Without an explanation of how it
698,e06-033-06.jpg,"works , it may well be that this outset , akin"
699,e06-033-07.jpg,"to the mouth of a great salmon river , has"
700,e06-033-08.jpg,been the biggest factor through the ages
701,e06-033-09.jpg,in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
702,e06-046-00.jpg,( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
703,e06-046-01.jpg,"be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed"
704,e06-046-02.jpg,"sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations"
705,e06-046-03.jpg,through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow
706,e06-046-04.jpg,"wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something"
707,e06-046-05.jpg,"to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught ."
708,e06-049-00.jpg,Let us consider first what would
709,e06-049-01.jpg,appear to be the simplest case -
710,e06-049-02.jpg,that of flat fish on the bottom .
711,e06-049-03.jpg,The evidence suggest that the fish are
712,e06-049-04.jpg,aware of the moving footrope before
713,e06-049-05.jpg,it reaches them . They move away before
714,e06-049-06.jpg,"it , swimming at the same speed"
715,e06-049-07.jpg,"for an unknown period of time , until"
716,e06-049-08.jpg,"they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used"
717,e06-049-09.jpg,to the disturbance .
718,e06-053-00.jpg,Then they stop swimming and are caught . In
719,e06-053-01.jpg,the seine-net film this usually seemed to
720,e06-053-02.jpg,happen just after the fish had risen above
721,e06-053-03.jpg,"the footrope , and presumably out of its"
722,e06-053-04.jpg,"field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests"
723,e06-053-05.jpg,that the wave might be transmitted by the
724,e06-053-06.jpg,"sea-bed , though the footrope in this case"
725,e06-053-07.jpg,was actually just off the bottom and was
726,e06-053-08.jpg,indeed passing over some fish .
727,e06-070-00.jpg,Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
728,e06-070-01.jpg,And in this film the rise of the fish was
729,e06-070-02.jpg,"small , a matter of a foot or two . With round"
730,e06-070-03.jpg,"fish like haddock , which would hardly"
731,e06-070-04.jpg,"find safety on the bottom , this cover"
732,e06-070-05.jpg,would seem to be even more essential ;
733,e06-070-06.jpg,but more films are needed to prove this .
734,e06-070-07.jpg,Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
735,e06-070-08.jpg,essential to catch round fish whose
736,e06-070-09.jpg,reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
737,f04-032-00.jpg,"They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so-"
738,f04-032-01.jpg,"me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a"
739,f04-032-02.jpg,man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
740,f04-032-03.jpg,"the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from"
741,f04-032-04.jpg,"his hands . The inquest was opened on February 17 , but ,"
742,f04-032-05.jpg,beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
743,f04-032-06.jpg,the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
744,f04-032-07.jpg,"in which she had died , there was nothing on"
745,f04-032-08.jpg,"which to proceed , and the inquest was"
746,f04-032-09.jpg,adjourned .
747,f04-035-00.jpg,Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
748,f04-035-01.jpg,trails . It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
749,f04-035-02.jpg,"money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for"
750,f04-035-03.jpg,a detailed account of his movements on the 11th . The dead
751,f04-035-04.jpg,woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
752,f04-035-05.jpg,named Brown .
753,f04-039-00.jpg,This man agreed that his engagement had
754,f04-039-01.jpg,been broken off after one particular
755,f04-039-02.jpg,"tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any"
756,f04-039-03.jpg,money . All the while the police were casting about
757,f04-039-04.jpg,for a man who had been seen leaving the train
758,f04-039-05.jpg,at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
759,f04-039-06.jpg,"as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with"
760,f04-039-07.jpg,"a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat"
761,f04-039-08.jpg,and a top-hat .
762,f04-043-00.jpg,The porter at the station bore out this
763,f04-043-01.jpg,"description , but the man was not traced ."
764,f04-043-02.jpg,"Perhaps the news of their search got around ,"
765,f04-043-03.jpg,for a man did obligingly present himself
766,f04-043-04.jpg,"at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have"
767,f04-043-05.jpg,committed the murder - but he was mentally
768,f04-043-06.jpg,"defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,"
769,f04-043-07.jpg,had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
770,f04-053-00.jpg,"And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with"
771,f04-053-01.jpg,"adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return"
772,f04-053-02.jpg,"a verdict of "" wilful murder against some person or"
773,f04-053-03.jpg,"persons unknown . "" The most vital clue of the Wedgwood"
774,f04-053-04.jpg,pestle had been of no assistance . The killer must
775,f04-053-05.jpg,have been very thankful that the science of
776,f04-053-06.jpg,dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
777,f04-057-00.jpg,"The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,"
778,f04-057-01.jpg,yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
779,f04-057-02.jpg,a further seven years before even a ghost of a
780,f04-057-03.jpg,solution emerged . There has always been something
781,f04-057-04.jpg,sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of
782,f04-057-05.jpg,them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
783,f04-057-06.jpg,nected with railway construction ; and there
784,f04-057-07.jpg,were many people who believed that to travel
785,f04-057-08.jpg,through tunnels would be an equally
786,f04-057-09.jpg,hazardous business .
787,f04-061-00.jpg,Some thought that the result would be all
788,f04-061-01.jpg,sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
789,f04-061-02.jpg,"confined atmosphere . "" The shareholders who travel"
790,f04-061-03.jpg,"by it will be so heartily sick , what with the"
791,f04-061-04.jpg,"foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention"
792,f04-061-05.jpg,"of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha , """
793,f04-061-06.jpg,wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
794,f04-061-07.jpg,proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
795,f04-064-00.jpg,The mere thought of subterranean travel
796,f04-064-01.jpg,gave others a feeling of danger . A medical journal
797,f04-064-02.jpg,"said , "" the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden"
798,f04-064-03.jpg,"immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated"
799,f04-064-04.jpg,sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
800,f04-064-05.jpg,"momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill"
801,f04-064-06.jpg,"of annihilation . "" It was also prophesied that"
802,f04-064-07.jpg,passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
803,f04-064-08.jpg,darkness .
804,f04-068-00.jpg,"For all that , as far as England is concerned ,"
805,f04-068-01.jpg,there have been only two occasions on
806,f04-068-02.jpg,which a body has been found in a tunnel
807,f04-068-03.jpg,in circumstances pointing to murder .
808,f04-068-04.jpg,"The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous"
809,f04-068-05.jpg,"Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy"

811,f04-068-07.jpg,victim was a woman .
812,f04-071-00.jpg,Though in the minds of most people there was
813,f04-071-01.jpg,no doubt that the woman had been the victim
814,f04-071-02.jpg,"of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there"
815,f04-071-03.jpg,was not sufficient evidence to show whether
816,f04-071-04.jpg,she had fallen or been thrown from a train .
817,f04-071-05.jpg,"The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to-"
818,f04-071-06.jpg,"Brighton line , is approximately one mile long ,"
819,f04-071-07.jpg,and some time before midnight on September
820,f04-071-08.jpg,"24 , 1905 , a Sunday , Sub-Inspector Peacock , of"
821,f04-071-09.jpg,"the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ,"
822,f04-074-00.jpg,It was the battered and broken body of a woman .
823,f04-074-01.jpg,He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
824,f04-074-02.jpg,"Station , and a stretcher party took the body to"
825,f04-074-03.jpg,the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
826,f04-074-04.jpg,"Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul"
827,f04-074-05.jpg,had walked deliberately into the blackness and
828,f04-074-06.jpg,into the path of some train ? This hardly seemed
829,f04-074-07.jpg,"likely , since , when she was examined by a local"
830,f04-074-08.jpg,"doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump ,"
831,f04-074-09.jpg,was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
832,f04-074-10.jpg,"almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends"
833,f04-074-11.jpg,thrust in her mouth like a gag .
834,f04-079-00.jpg,"Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,"
835,f04-079-01.jpg,and there were other injuries on her body which had
836,f04-079-02.jpg,occurred before her death was ensured by some
837,f04-079-03.jpg,train which had roared through the tunnel . There were
838,f04-079-04.jpg,no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
839,f04-079-05.jpg,"fication , no money , and no railway ticket . By then"
840,f04-079-06.jpg,reports were being gathered about all traffic over
841,f04-079-07.jpg,"this stretch of line , but no information was"
842,f04-079-08.jpg,forthcoming about any carriage with an open
843,f04-079-09.jpg,"door , nor any passenger reporting an incident"
844,f04-079-10.jpg,which might relate .
845,f04-083-00.jpg,So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
846,f04-083-01.jpg,long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
847,f04-083-02.jpg,remained a mystery until later the following day .
848,f04-083-03.jpg,During that time a description of the girl was
849,f04-083-04.jpg,"circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to"
850,f04-083-05.jpg,"identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two ."
851,f04-083-06.jpg,"The girl , who was described as being "" always bright and"
852,f04-083-07.jpg,"jolly , "" had been unmarried , and lived at Lavender Hill ,"
853,f04-083-08.jpg,"Clapham , on the premises of a dairyman , Bridger , for"
854,f04-083-09.jpg,whom she worked as a book-keeper .
855,f04-087-00.jpg,"On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the"
856,f04-087-01.jpg,"evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma"
857,f04-087-02.jpg,"Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be"
858,f04-087-03.jpg,"gone for long . According to Miss Hone , she had not been"

861,f07-000-00.jpg,SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
862,f07-000-01.jpg,told us that there was nothing an En-

864,f07-000-03.jpg,rican would not say ; nothing an
865,f07-000-04.jpg,Italian would not sing ; no music
866,f07-000-05.jpg,to which the Frenchman would not
867,f07-000-06.jpg,dance ; nothing the German would
868,f07-000-07.jpg,not covet ; and nothing the Chinese
869,f07-000-08.jpg,would not eat .
870,f07-000b-00.jpg,SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
871,f07-000b-01.jpg,told us that there was nothing an Englishman
872,f07-000b-02.jpg,would not do ; nothing an American would not
873,f07-000b-03.jpg,say ; nothing an Italian would not sing ; no
874,f07-000b-04.jpg,music to which the Frenchman would not dance ;
875,f07-000b-05.jpg,nothing the German would not covet ; and
876,f07-000b-06.jpg,nothing the Chinese would not eat .
877,f07-002-00.jpg,It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum .
878,f07-002-01.jpg,Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
879,f07-002-02.jpg,the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
880,f07-002-03.jpg,borrowed straight from the prehistoric . How
881,f07-002-04.jpg,"many centuries ago , in some cave or hilly"
882,f07-002-05.jpg,"hide , did our forebears home from the chase"
883,f07-002-06.jpg,hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
884,f07-002-07.jpg,meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
885,f07-002-08.jpg,homely and protecting flame .
886,f07-006-00.jpg,How many centuries later did the mercenary in
887,f07-006-01.jpg,the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
888,f07-006-02.jpg,"evening meal . Later came the thrifty peasant ,"
889,f07-006-03.jpg,later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
890,f07-006-04.jpg,"in Paris , and even later our attractive young"
891,f07-006-05.jpg,ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
892,f07-006-06.jpg,gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants .
893,f07-009-00.jpg,"And , if certain dishes and modes of food have"
894,f07-009-01.jpg,"persisted down the ages , the motive that preserved"
895,f07-009-02.jpg,them has always been the same . Apart from the need
896,f07-009-03.jpg,"for nourishment , the instinct of hospitality has"
897,f07-009-04.jpg,always been strong in mankind . The sharing of
898,f07-009-05.jpg,a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
899,f07-009-06.jpg,admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
900,f07-009-07.jpg,important than the casual meetings of the present
901,f07-009-08.jpg,day ; the desire to share something more intimate
902,f07-009-09.jpg,than mere converse has always been there .
903,f07-013-00.jpg,The truth is that good food offers a
904,f07-013-01.jpg,programme of entertainment almost
905,f07-013-02.jpg,unlimited in its variety and its presen-
906,f07-013-03.jpg,tation affords an opportunity of
907,f07-013-04.jpg,showing a guest something of ourselves .
908,f07-013-05.jpg,It is a far enough cry from the primitive
909,f07-013-06.jpg,meal-times of a simpler world to the
910,f07-013-07.jpg,"banquets of later days , when the table"
911,f07-013-08.jpg,groaned under its load of complicated
912,f07-013-09.jpg,"dishes , and for all the blossoming of the"
913,f07-013-10.jpg,arts around them the diners were little
914,f07-016-00.jpg,There was always the spice of an orgy
915,f07-016-01.jpg,"in those Roman feasts , for instance , with"
916,f07-016-02.jpg,all their peacocks and nightingales'
917,f07-016-03.jpg,"tongues ; unreasonable surfeit , too , in the"
918,f07-016-04.jpg,elaborate fashion of eating brought
919,f07-016-05.jpg,"out of Italy into France , we are told ,"
920,f07-016-06.jpg,by Catherine de Medici . The peasant in
921,f07-016-07.jpg,"those days , as ever , ate sparingly , but"
922,f07-016-08.jpg,"generously enough in his own fashion ,"
923,f07-016-09.jpg,"save at feast times , when he , too , let"
924,f07-016-10.jpg,himself go ; and it was from his simpler
925,f07-019a-00.jpg,"Epicures and gourmands , sated by the unending"
926,f07-019a-01.jpg,procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
927,f07-019a-02.jpg,of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
928,f07-019a-03.jpg,grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
929,f07-019a-04.jpg,"the dishes of the country , and , instead of gorging the"

983,f07-028a-00.jpg,"When , however , the Greeks did learn the art of making"
984,f07-028a-01.jpg,"fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians , their cookery"
985,f07-028a-02.jpg,"made rapid progress , because they were men of taste"
986,f07-028a-03.jpg,and intellect . A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
987,f07-028a-04.jpg,of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
988,f07-028a-05.jpg,confine the resources of the table to the gratification
989,f07-028a-06.jpg,of one sense alone . Having exhausted their invention
990,f07-028a-07.jpg,"in the preparation of stimulants for the palate ,"
991,f07-028a-08.jpg,they broke fresh ground and called another sense
992,f07-028a-09.jpg,to their aid .
993,f07-032a-00.jpg,By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
994,f07-032a-01.jpg,"perfumes , these refined voluptuaries aroused the"
995,f07-032a-02.jpg,fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
996,f07-032a-03.jpg,ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
997,f07-032a-04.jpg,board . The gratification of the sense of smelling
998,f07-032a-05.jpg,was a subject of no little importance to the Romans .
999,f07-032a-06.jpg,They considered flowers as forming a very essential
1000,f07-032a-07.jpg,article in their festal preparations ; and it is the
1001,f07-032a-08.jpg,opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
1002,f07-032a-09.jpg,number of flowers far exceeded the number
1003,f07-032a-10.jpg,of fruits .
1004,f07-039a-00.jpg,"According to Pliny , and others , certain herbs"
1005,f07-039a-01.jpg,and flowers proved of sovereign power
1006,f07-039a-02.jpg,clarifying the functions of the brain . It
1007,f07-039a-03.jpg,is said that there is nothing new under
1008,f07-039a-04.jpg,"the sun , but regarding foodstuffs the"
1009,f07-039a-05.jpg,traveller occasionally encounters a certain
1010,f07-039a-06.jpg,measure of novelty .
1011,f07-042a-00.jpg,"In China , for instance , dried rats are esteemed"
1012,f07-042a-01.jpg,a delicacy . The visitor is told that
1013,f07-042a-02.jpg,they restore the hair of the bald and that
1014,f07-042a-03.jpg,a stewed black rat will ward off a fever .
1015,f07-042a-04.jpg,A number of newly-born white mice served
1016,f07-042a-05.jpg,"alive , dipped in treacle and swallowed"
1017,f07-042a-06.jpg,like a prairie oyster is considered a
1018,f07-042a-07.jpg,piece of resistance .
1019,f07-046a-00.jpg,Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards
1020,f07-046a-01.jpg,roasted on the point of a spear are
1021,f07-046a-02.jpg,definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean
1022,f07-046a-03.jpg,peoples have a high opinion of the octopus
1023,f07-046a-04.jpg,as an article of diet . So have the Japanese
1024,f07-046a-05.jpg,"and the Chinese . The Celestials , apart"
1025,f07-046a-06.jpg,"from eating it fresh , squash it , press"

1027,f07-046a-08.jpg,"over with flour , you will find a stack"
1028,f07-046a-09.jpg,of it in almost any provision shop .
1029,f07-069-00.jpg,Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
1030,f07-069-01.jpg,than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
1031,f07-069-02.jpg,activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed .
1032,f07-069-03.jpg,We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
1033,f07-069-04.jpg,one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
1034,f07-069-05.jpg,which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years .
1035,f07-069-06.jpg,If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
1036,f07-069-07.jpg,"with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation ,"
1037,f07-069-08.jpg,Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
1038,f07-069-09.jpg,provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
1039,f07-073-00.jpg,The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
1040,f07-073-01.jpg,Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
1041,f07-073-02.jpg,aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious

1045,f07-073-06.jpg,"cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights , of Spanish dancing"
1046,f07-073-07.jpg,"and of Goja : it is vivid , highly coloured , sometimes"
1047,f07-073-08.jpg,"Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour , with"
1048,f07-073-09.jpg,"streaks of poetry , meat disguised under heavy and vehement"
1049,f07-076a-00.jpg,"The Czechoslovak kitchen , again , is"
1050,f07-076a-01.jpg,"so languorous , so passionate , and"
1051,f07-076a-02.jpg,possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
1052,f07-076a-03.jpg,melody . The paprika and caraway perfume

1054,f07-076a-05.jpg,opulent varieties of Czechoslovak past-

1056,f07-076a-07.jpg,of rich embroideries and costumes

1143,g01-004-00.jpg,It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
1144,g01-004-01.jpg,"Londoners , but it brought heavy censure from nobles"
1145,g01-004-02.jpg,who still believed that they had a monopoly of

1150,g01-008-01.jpg,trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
1151,g01-008-02.jpg,on land . Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
1152,g01-008-03.jpg,"an elusive foe , and , afraid to return home without"
1153,g01-008-04.jpg,"something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege"
1154,g01-008-05.jpg,the well-protected fortress of St Malo . This
1155,g01-008-06.jpg,involved the dreary method of mining operations in

1171,g01-016-06.jpg,"and that , if archers had no target , campaigns"
1172,g01-016-07.jpg,became mere marauding route marches .
1173,g01-019-00.jpg,It seems obvious that if an expedition to
1174,g01-019-01.jpg,"Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais ,"
1175,g01-019-02.jpg,then the primary essential to the success
1176,g01-019-03.jpg,of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
1177,g01-019-04.jpg,command of the Channel . It seems obvious
1178,g01-019-05.jpg,that divided forces were dissipating the
1179,g01-019-06.jpg,advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
1180,g01-019-07.jpg,"Calais , Cherbourg , Brest , Bordeaux and Bayonne ,"
1181,g01-019-08.jpg,and that there was no hope of final victory
1182,g01-019-09.jpg,without a large-scale and concentrated invasion .
1183,g01-025-00.jpg,In this cruel process which was
1184,g01-025-01.jpg,hammering out nations on the anvils of
1185,g01-025-02.jpg,"war , there was a constant stirring of"
1186,g01-025-03.jpg,those in authority to find some simple
1187,g01-025-04.jpg,way out of the complicated financial
1188,g01-025-05.jpg,"6impasse which always resulted , and in the"
1189,g01-025-06.jpg,story of the experiments and expedients
1190,g01-025-07.jpg,to which the Exchequer resorted is
1191,g01-025-08.jpg,the story of the prelude to the
1192,g01-025-09.jpg,Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
1193,g01-027-00.jpg,"In appreciating this story , modern con-"
1194,g01-027-01.jpg,ceptions of governmental duties must be
1195,g01-027-02.jpg,set aside . A modern government needs
1196,g01-027-03.jpg,taxation not merely for defence and
1197,g01-027-04.jpg,offence but for a very wide range of
1198,g01-027-05.jpg,social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
1199,g01-027-06.jpg,needed taxation in order to supplement
1200,g01-027-07.jpg,the private wealth of the monarchy
1201,g01-027-08.jpg,( the royal income from the revenues of
1202,g01-027-09.jpg,"crown lands , the fees of feudalism"
1203,g01-031-00.jpg,Social service as a function of government
1204,g01-031-01.jpg,was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
1205,g01-031-02.jpg,substitute was the mutual self-help of
1206,g01-031-03.jpg,"communities , whether those communities were"
1207,g01-031-04.jpg,"monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and"
1208,g01-031-05.jpg,guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was
1209,g01-031-06.jpg,therefore in essence a forced payment whose
1210,g01-031-07.jpg,return was the uncertain bounty of booty
1211,g01-031-08.jpg,and the vague advantages of military glory ;
1212,g01-031-09.jpg,it was therefore always granted grudgingly
1213,g01-031-10.jpg,"and coupled with the vain hope that , in the"
1214,g01-034-00.jpg,When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
1215,g01-034-01.jpg,"booty , a new group of Lords might oust"
1216,g01-034-02.jpg,"the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,"
1217,g01-034-03.jpg,"who usually supplied the hard cash , might"
1218,g01-034-04.jpg,be bold enough to demand the production of

1220,g01-034-06.jpg,the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not
1221,g01-034-07.jpg,"the people , and even a full Parliament was"
1222,g01-034-08.jpg,not yet a true mirror of the nation .
1223,g01-037-00.jpg,The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
1224,g01-037-01.jpg,' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
1225,g01-037-02.jpg,feudal obligations of work or villeins who
1226,g01-037-03.jpg,"had bought their release , free labourers"
1227,g01-037-04.jpg,"who worked for the highest bidders , free"

1229,g01-037-06.jpg,"successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,"
1230,g01-037-07.jpg,journeymen and small tradesmen of the
1231,g01-037-08.jpg,"towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms"
1232,g01-037-09.jpg,in the pay of landed Lords .
1233,g01-039-00.jpg,"None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or"
1234,g01-039-01.jpg,expected to pay direct taxes . During the four-
1235,g01-039-02.jpg,"teenth century , the traditional methods of"
1236,g01-039-03.jpg,financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .

1242,g01-039-09.jpg,"pervised and controlled , together with a"
1243,g01-043-00.jpg,There were two other sources of public revenue -
1244,g01-043-01.jpg,"first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead"
1245,g01-043-02.jpg,of the Commons and in its own Convocations
1246,g01-043-03.jpg,"granted equivalent contributions , and second ,"
1247,g01-043-04.jpg,"the foreign merchants , with whom the King's"
1248,g01-043-05.jpg,officials had formerly made private bargains
1249,g01-043-06.jpg,"at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose"
1250,g01-043-07.jpg,payments were now authorized by parliamentary
1251,g01-043-08.jpg,sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
1252,g01-043-09.jpg,excess of the rate for native merchants .
1253,g01-045-00.jpg,"In addition to these revenues , the King had the"
1254,g01-045-01.jpg,financial benefits of his position at the head
1255,g01-045-02.jpg,"of the feudal system , as its chief landowner"
1256,g01-045-03.jpg,and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
1257,g01-045-04.jpg,"It was , therefore , a complicated and not very"
1258,g01-045-05.jpg,satisfactory financial system in which the
1259,g01-045-06.jpg,borders between private and public purse were
1260,g01-045-07.jpg,as ill-defined as the borders between private
1261,g01-045-08.jpg,"and national war , and in which the comparati-"
1262,g01-045-09.jpg,vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
1263,g01-067-00.jpg,But this time there was a very interesting
1264,g01-067-01.jpg,attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
1265,g01-067-02.jpg,payments demanded . The definition of an
1266,g01-067-03.jpg,"adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,"
1267,g01-067-04.jpg,"and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,"
1268,g01-067-05.jpg,the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
1269,g01-067-06.jpg,"of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,"
1270,g01-067-07.jpg,and between these two extremes a graduated
1271,g01-067-08.jpg,scale of payments was fixed for the
1272,g01-067-09.jpg,different classes of laymen and clerics .
1273,g01-070-00.jpg,Again the resentment was widespread and
1274,g01-070-01.jpg,the results disappointing - a tax estimated
1275,g01-070-02.jpg,"to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 ."
1276,g01-070-03.jpg,"In the following year , 1380 , the last and"
1277,g01-070-04.jpg,most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
1278,g01-070-05.jpg,by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
1279,g01-070-06.jpg,There were dark reasons for a meeting so
1280,g01-070-07.jpg,far away from the capital in a town with
1281,g01-070-08.jpg,poor communications and not over supplied
1282,g01-070-09.jpg,with hostelries and lodgings .
1283,g01-074-00.jpg,London was again in turmoil ; but this time
1284,g01-074-01.jpg,over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-
1285,g01-074-02.jpg,"chant from Genoa had been murdered , and"
1286,g01-074-03.jpg,"John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of"
1287,g01-074-04.jpg,those charged with the crime . It is clear
1288,g01-074-05.jpg,from the chronicles that this was a sordid
1289,g01-074-06.jpg,quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
1290,g01-074-07.jpg,The city merchants were jealous of foreign
1291,g01-074-08.jpg,merchants who could tempt court and
1292,g01-074-09.jpg,baronage with rarer luxuries than those
1293,g01-088-00.jpg,Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
1294,g01-088-01.jpg,"arithmetic which argued that , as the first"
1295,g01-088-02.jpg,"poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of"
1296,g01-088-03.jpg,"three times the rate would produce 66,000 ."
1297,g01-088-04.jpg,The only concession made in view of the
1298,g01-088-05.jpg,objections to the first two poll-taxes was
1299,g01-088-06.jpg,the suggestion that the rich should help
1300,g01-088-07.jpg,the poor - but this was only a pious hope
1301,g01-088-08.jpg,because no machinery was provided for
1302,g01-088-09.jpg,"carrying it into effect , and a subordinate"

1351,g03-004-04.jpg,12 o'clock at night . At that time pastries and buns
1352,g03-004-05.jpg,were sold at 32 pieces for one shilling .
1353,g03-032-00.jpg,Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings .
1354,g03-032-01.jpg,One of the helpful by-products was that
1355,g03-032-02.jpg,they were able to obtain some respectable
1356,g03-032-03.jpg,"clothing , with which they wore a white tie"
1357,g03-032-04.jpg,"and Red Flag badge , thus presenting a much"
1358,g03-032-05.jpg,"better appearance . Later , on many a sunny Sunday"
1359,g03-032-06.jpg,"evening , when George went to speak at Malin Bridge ,"
1360,g03-032-07.jpg,they would be there to begin the meeting .
1361,g03-040-00.jpg,As they became known the Choir went to working-
1362,g03-040-01.jpg,"men's clubs , to Conisborough on cheap trips to"
1363,g03-040-02.jpg,"sing to the miners , and sang for other organisations such"
1364,g03-040-03.jpg,"as the Bakers' Union , for whom they went on Satur-"
1365,g03-040-04.jpg,"day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel , to rally"
1366,g03-040-05.jpg,the members . The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
1367,g03-040-06.jpg,"on West Street , where a successful Sunday"
1368,g03-040-07.jpg,school was held .
1369,g03-043-00.jpg,One of the students was young
1370,g03-043-01.jpg,"George , and another the dark-haired"
1371,g03-043-02.jpg,little granddaughter of Charlie Grant .
1372,g03-043-03.jpg,George often spoke at the Sunday school .
1373,g03-043-04.jpg,"He christened the babies . Also , when"
1374,g03-043-05.jpg,"called upon to do so , he would officiate"
1375,g03-043-06.jpg,at funerals . Religion was one of his pet
1376,g03-043-07.jpg,"subjects , for being well acquainted"
1377,g03-043-08.jpg,"with the Bible , which he had"
1378,g03-043-09.jpg,read in prison where it was the
1379,g03-043-10.jpg,"only book they were allowed ,"
1380,g03-049-00.jpg,Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
1381,g03-049-01.jpg,to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
1382,g03-049-02.jpg,"with them , particularly those who , like the Rev."
1383,g03-049-03.jpg,"Conrad Noel , the eloquent leader of"
1384,g03-049-04.jpg,"the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated"
1385,g03-049-05.jpg,"socialism . With such men , who had the"
1386,g03-049-06.jpg,courage of their convictions and their
1387,g03-049-07.jpg,"Christianity , common ground could be found ."
1388,g03-052-00.jpg,There was no abatement in political
1389,g03-052-01.jpg,work . The British Socialist Party endea-
1390,g03-052-02.jpg,voured to get more socialist members sent to the
1391,g03-052-03.jpg,"Council , and to Parliament , being deter-"
1392,g03-052-04.jpg,mined and obdurate in their attitude that
1393,g03-052-05.jpg,their candidate must go forward in the
1394,g03-052-06.jpg,elections . In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
1395,g03-052-07.jpg,"Council meeting on October 16 , 1912 , George"
1396,g03-052-08.jpg,"had said , ' Mr. Barton would go to the poll ."
1397,g03-052-09.jpg,Just as the Labour Party had fought the
1398,g03-052-10.jpg,"Liberals , they were going to fight the Labour"
1399,g03-064-00.jpg,"Alf Barton , who in 1911 was presented"
1400,g03-064-01.jpg,"with a book on the life of Marx ,"
1401,g03-064-02.jpg,and a gold purse in recognition of his
1402,g03-064-03.jpg,"work for the movement , was later"
1403,g03-064-04.jpg,known to say that it was not ne-
1404,g03-064-05.jpg,cessary to understand Marxism in order to
1405,g03-064-06.jpg,"understand socialism , though at this time"
1406,g03-064-07.jpg,he was a keen member of the B.S.P. .
1407,g04-022-00.jpg,"After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit"
1408,g04-022-01.jpg,"Germany for ten years , by which time in"
1409,g04-022-02.jpg,1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
1410,g04-022-03.jpg,Towards the end of my five and a half years'
1411,g04-022-04.jpg,incumbency I was asked if I would start
1412,g04-022-05.jpg,a village choral society and conduct it .
1413,g04-022-06.jpg,"This opened up a new interest , and we plunged"
1414,g04-022-07.jpg,into it .
1415,g04-043-00.jpg,But what a change from the dear little old church
1416,g04-043-01.jpg,at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
1417,g04-043-02.jpg,"at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the"
1418,g04-043-03.jpg,"church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries"
1419,g04-043-04.jpg,had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
1420,g04-043-05.jpg,"chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is ."
1421,g04-043-06.jpg,When we had found a group of people who gladly
1422,g04-043-07.jpg,"co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place"
1423,g04-043-08.jpg,of daily prayer .
1424,g04-048-00.jpg,I suggested to the congregation that it needed
1425,g04-048-01.jpg,"warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we"
1426,g04-048-02.jpg,found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
1427,g04-048-03.jpg,stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
1428,g04-048-04.jpg,helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
1429,g04-048-05.jpg,for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
1430,g04-048-06.jpg,"gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West"
1431,g04-048-07.jpg,windows .
1432,g04-052-00.jpg,It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
1433,g04-052-01.jpg,such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
1434,g04-052-02.jpg,a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
1435,g04-052-03.jpg,"the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible"
1436,g04-052-04.jpg,to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
1437,g04-052-05.jpg,and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
1438,g04-052-06.jpg,table to the environs .
1439,g04-068-00.jpg,Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
1440,g04-068-01.jpg,co-operation especially with the other Christian communities .
1441,g04-068-02.jpg,At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
1442,g04-068-03.jpg,' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
1443,g04-068-04.jpg,"I found myself deeply involved . At first , the main work was to help"
1444,g04-068-05.jpg,wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
1445,g04-068-06.jpg,"allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased"
1446,g04-068-07.jpg,in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
1447,g04-068-08.jpg,"became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman"
1448,g04-068-09.jpg,of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
1449,g04-072-00.jpg,"Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at"
1450,g04-072-01.jpg,"Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously"
1451,g04-072-02.jpg,Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee . This
1452,g04-072-03.jpg,task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
1453,g04-072-04.jpg,"the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents ,"
1454,g04-072-05.jpg,and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries . Our
1455,g04-072-06.jpg,"Committee met once a week in the evenings , and"
1456,g04-072-07.jpg,included professional men from every walk of
1457,g04-072-08.jpg,life .
1458,g07-000b-00.jpg,"When he saw Trelawny's printed letter , Lord Sidney wrote"
1459,g07-000b-01.jpg,to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
1460,g07-000b-02.jpg,throughout . He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
1461,g07-000b-03.jpg,and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
1462,g07-000b-04.jpg,body to return to England than that course was
1463,g07-000b-05.jpg,' immediately carried into effect ' - not in spite of himself
1464,g07-000b-06.jpg,"and Sir Frederick Stoven , but with their perfect con-"
1465,g07-000b-07.jpg,"currence , while ' General Adam was at Corfu the whole"
1466,g07-000b-08.jpg,time and # never interfered in the slightest
1467,g07-000b-09.jpg,degree about the matter ' .
1468,g07-079a-00.jpg,Their friendship for Augusta became rather
1469,g07-079a-01.jpg,"hollow , and the news that Byron had left"
1470,g07-079a-02.jpg,her practically all his money caused it to
1471,g07-079a-03.jpg,crumble to oblivion . Though Lady Byron
1472,g07-079a-04.jpg,"knew perfectly well that Byron , as early"
1473,g07-079a-05.jpg,"as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had"
1474,g07-079a-06.jpg,"made a will in Augusta's favour , she had"
1475,g07-079a-07.jpg,evidently not passed on that information ;
1476,g07-079a-08.jpg,and it came as an appalling surprise to
1477,g07-079a-09.jpg,Captain Byron that he had been left
1478,g07-079a-10.jpg,without the fortune that would keep up the
1479,g07-079a-11.jpg,title .
1480,m01-049-00.jpg,He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
1481,m01-049-01.jpg,"and came into the livingroom , where"
1482,m01-049-02.jpg,Heather and Steve stood aghast at
1483,m01-049-03.jpg,"his entrance . He came , almost falling"
1484,m01-049-04.jpg,"forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck"
1485,m01-049-05.jpg,"thrust out , arms dangling loosely ."
1486,m01-049-06.jpg,"Then , abruptly , he drew himself up"
1487,m01-049-07.jpg,and walked on the very tips of
1488,m01-049-08.jpg,his toes . He stretched his arms
1489,m01-049-09.jpg,"over his head and yawned agape ,"
1490,m01-049-10.jpg,drawing-in great breaths that
1491,m01-049-11.jpg,became great sighs of ecstacy .
1492,m01-060-00.jpg,""" They have come ! "" he said reverently , gripping his"
1493,m01-060-01.jpg,hands together between his knees and leaning
1494,m01-060-02.jpg,"forward . "" Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited"
1495,m01-060-03.jpg,"transcendent event , the exalted desire of all"
1496,m01-060-04.jpg,mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the
1497,m01-060-05.jpg,"Mind is at hand ! "" He turned beaming eyes"
1498,m01-060-06.jpg,upward and shook his head slowly from
1499,m01-060-07.jpg,side to side .
1500,m01-079-00.jpg,A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
1501,m01-079-01.jpg,abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
1502,m01-079-02.jpg,at an intersection for the light to change . At his
1503,m01-079-03.jpg,apartment he garaged his car and then stood
1504,m01-079-04.jpg,listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the
1505,m01-079-05.jpg,"earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart"
1506,m01-079-06.jpg,loses its beat in death .
1507,m01-084-00.jpg,"Deadly stillness , deadly portent !"
1508,m01-084-01.jpg,Steve awakened early and switched on
1509,m01-084-02.jpg,"the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO."
1510,m01-084-03.jpg,The set lighted-up but gave only a low
1511,m01-084-04.jpg,buzzing sound . He had just finished
1512,m01-084-05.jpg,"shaving when it came on , with a flat"
1513,m01-084-06.jpg,"voice repeating : "" This is BBC calling"
1514,m01-084-07.jpg,"... this is BBC calling ... """
1515,m01-095-00.jpg,Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
1516,m01-095-01.jpg,"Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A"
1517,m01-095-02.jpg,flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
1518,m01-095-03.jpg,the War Memorial . There was a deep
1519,m01-095-04.jpg,"whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing"
1520,m01-095-05.jpg,overtone that sang in his ears with an
1521,m01-095-06.jpg,almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
1522,m01-095-07.jpg,turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
1523,m01-104-00.jpg,""" The Thetans , "" he said , "" are presumably here to"
1524,m01-104-01.jpg,"take charge , as it were , of the minds of the"
1525,m01-104-02.jpg,people - who are probably falling all over them-
1526,m01-104-03.jpg,selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
1527,m01-104-04.jpg,"them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't"
1528,m01-104-05.jpg,"know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-"
1529,m01-104-06.jpg,caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
1530,m01-104-07.jpg,longer have any immunity .
1531,m01-110-00.jpg,There can be little doubt that if the
1532,m01-110-01.jpg,Thetans discover our mental independence
1533,m01-110-02.jpg,they will promptly give us their hypnotic
1534,m01-110-03.jpg,treatment . If we can avoid undue
1535,m01-110-04.jpg,"prominence , it may be that we can"
1536,m01-110-05.jpg,move about pretty freely without
1537,m01-110-06.jpg,"detection . If we can - well , then we"
1538,m01-110-07.jpg,may be able to promote our own
1539,m01-110-08.jpg,interests . What those interests
1540,m01-110-09.jpg,"are , beyond personal security ,"
1541,m01-110-10.jpg,"I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,"
1542,m01-110-11.jpg,we may form the nucleus around ...
1543,m01-121-00.jpg,There is just a hope that we may uncover
1544,m01-121-01.jpg,"some weakness , and find a way of fighting"
1545,m01-121-02.jpg,"back at them . "" Heather agreed , and suggested"
1546,m01-121-03.jpg,that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
1547,m01-121-04.jpg,ting how the Thetan machinations had been
1548,m01-121-05.jpg,working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
1549,m01-121-06.jpg,not have been entirely an objective suggestion
1550,m01-121-07.jpg,on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
1551,m01-121-08.jpg,nevertheless .
1552,m01-125-00.jpg,So they proceeded to see if the coast
1553,m01-125-01.jpg,was clear . The street was quiet and
1554,m01-125-02.jpg,"deserted , and there were neither sight"
1555,m01-125-03.jpg,nor sound of flying saucers . So they
1556,m01-125-04.jpg,ventured forth and made their way on
1557,m01-125-05.jpg,foot to Dan's house . Dan came
1558,m01-125-06.jpg,to the door at their ring but neglected
1559,m01-125-07.jpg,to offer any greeting . He was deeply
1560,m01-125-08.jpg,"preoccupied , and it seemed that the"
1561,m01-125-09.jpg,ringing of a doorbell was to him
1562,m01-125-10.jpg,a new and strange phenomenon .
1563,m01-131-00.jpg,"When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action"
1564,m01-131-01.jpg,gave the impression of having been thought out and
1565,m01-131-02.jpg,"decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while"
1566,m01-131-03.jpg,Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware
1567,m01-131-04.jpg,"of their presence . They just stared at him , turning"
1568,m01-131-05.jpg,their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
1569,m01-131-06.jpg,"down , up and down ."
1570,m01-136-00.jpg,His whole attitude was a mixture of
1571,m01-136-01.jpg,impatience pending an awaited
1572,m01-136-02.jpg,communication and of a vague
1573,m01-136-03.jpg,perplexity respecting his surroundings
1574,m01-136-04.jpg,and the purpose he was to serve .
1575,m01-136-05.jpg,"Finally , being so obviously on their own ,"
1576,m01-136-06.jpg,Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
1577,m01-136-07.jpg,at home . Steve switched on Dan's
1578,m01-136-08.jpg,"powerful , world-wide radio and systematically"
1579,m01-136-09.jpg,turned the tuning knob through all the
1580,m01-136-10.jpg,tuning points of the world's great radio
1581,m01-149-00.jpg,"They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where"
1582,m01-149-01.jpg,he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
1583,m01-149-02.jpg,"But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
1584,m01-149-03.jpg,the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have
1585,m01-149-04.jpg,"been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies ."
1586,m01-149-05.jpg,"First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone"
1587,m01-149-06.jpg,"walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of"
1588,m01-149-07.jpg,a single all-exclusive purpose .
1589,m02-048-00.jpg,Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
1590,m02-048-01.jpg,real days and would return to New York in late
1591,m02-048-02.jpg,January or early February . Angelina might be a
1592,m02-048-03.jpg,little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
1593,m02-048-04.jpg,"as arranged , but he consoled himself by"
1594,m02-048-05.jpg,thinking that he and Angelina would have
1595,m02-048-06.jpg,plenty of time together in the future . And
1596,m02-048-07.jpg,"Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be"

1941,m06-098-04.jpg,"afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road"
1942,m06-098-05.jpg,of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
1943,m06-098-06.jpg,everlasting night .
1944,m06-106-00.jpg,"Motion there was , but motion without event - except"
1945,m06-106-01.jpg,for those negligible events that seemed so large to
1946,m06-106-02.jpg,"the creatures participating in them . For Lily-yo , Flor"
1947,m06-106-03.jpg,and Haris there were many events . Chief of these was
1948,m06-106-04.jpg,that they learned to fly properly . The pains associated
1949,m06-106-05.jpg,with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
1950,m06-106-06.jpg,new flesh and tendon strengthened . To sail up in the
1951,m06-106-07.jpg,light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
1952,m06-106-08.jpg,flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
1953,m06-106-09.jpg,had no place here .
1954,n01-000-00.jpg,Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
1955,n01-000-01.jpg,been inclined to regard women as something
1956,n01-000-02.jpg,which must necessarily be subordinated to his
1957,n01-000-03.jpg,career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
1958,n01-000-04.jpg,"his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl"
1959,n01-000-05.jpg,whom he had never met and on whom after no more
1960,n01-000-06.jpg,than a couple of telephone calls he was
1961,n01-000-07.jpg,prepared to place complete reliance .
1962,n01-004-00.jpg,It was a novel experience . Alastair was
1963,n01-004-01.jpg,quite unable to explain why he should feel
1964,n01-004-02.jpg,so much confidence in her . Once again
1965,n01-004-03.jpg,she checked back her instructions . It was
1966,n01-004-04.jpg,obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
1967,n01-004-05.jpg,faith which he was placing in her and
1968,n01-004-06.jpg,was prepared to accept the responsibility .
1969,n01-009-00.jpg,""" Good luck , Air Marshal , "" she said gently . "" I'll"
1970,n01-009-01.jpg,be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
1971,n01-009-02.jpg,evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
1972,n01-009-03.jpg,"both at midnight . "" They might have been"
1973,n01-009-04.jpg,arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
1974,n01-009-05.jpg,Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
1975,n01-009-06.jpg,uneventful life had he come across a girl who
1976,n01-009-07.jpg,sounded so charming and appeared to be so
1977,n01-009-08.jpg,efficient .
1978,n01-020-00.jpg,For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
1979,n01-020-01.jpg,to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
1980,n01-020-02.jpg,physical features were distinguishable solely by
1981,n01-020-03.jpg,gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
1982,n01-020-04.jpg,"capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles"
1983,n01-020-05.jpg,"below , was not recognisable among the host"
1984,n01-020-06.jpg,of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
1985,n01-020-07.jpg,radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
1986,n01-020-08.jpg,"flickered across its surface , but there was"
1987,n01-020-09.jpg,no permanent image .
1988,n01-031-00.jpg,In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
1989,n01-031-01.jpg,make a direct comparison between the radar
1990,n01-031-02.jpg,image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
1991,n01-031-03.jpg,"Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the"
1992,n01-031-04.jpg,"left , Milan . The directional angle of the"
1993,n01-031-05.jpg,scanner could be adjusted to cover any
1994,n01-031-06.jpg,particular area within its range . Geoffrey
1995,n01-031-07.jpg,turned the scale slowly to cover the
1996,n01-031-08.jpg,ground immediately ahead .
1997,n01-036-00.jpg,"He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the"
1998,n01-036-01.jpg,"naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even"
1999,n01-036-02.jpg,on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
2000,n01-036-03.jpg,at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
2001,n01-036-04.jpg,the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
2002,n01-036-05.jpg,was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
2003,n01-045-00.jpg,"Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the"
2004,n01-045-01.jpg,pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
2005,n01-045-02.jpg,dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
2006,n01-045-03.jpg,"recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0"
2007,n01-045-04.jpg,"before coming to rest at 5.0 . "" We're a bit"
2008,n01-045-05.jpg,"ahead of time , "" said Alastair . "" We'll run"
2009,n01-045-06.jpg,"in on minimum engine power . "" Geoffrey"
2010,n01-045-07.jpg,smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
2011,n01-045-08.jpg,they were still more than four hundred
2012,n01-045-09.jpg,miles from their destination .
2013,n01-052-00.jpg,They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
2014,n01-052-01.jpg,"on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port ."
2015,n01-052-02.jpg,He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
2016,n01-052-03.jpg,"thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,"
2017,n01-052-04.jpg,along which he had motored so desperately little
2018,n01-052-05.jpg,more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then
2019,n01-052-06.jpg,"he had flown to England , attended the vital"
2020,n01-052-07.jpg,"conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked"
2021,n01-052-08.jpg,by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
2022,n01-052-09.jpg,"Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed"
2023,n01-052-10.jpg,refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
2024,n01-052-11.jpg,of the journey back to the place where every
2025,n01-052-12.jpg,indication pointed to Eve being held .
2026,n01-057-00.jpg,Geoffrey set himself to consider the
2027,n01-057-01.jpg,movements of the Bentley . It had passed
2028,n01-057-02.jpg,him at the temporary bridge over the
2029,n01-057-03.jpg,Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
2030,n01-057-04.jpg,previous night . He worked out the distance
2031,n01-057-05.jpg,on the presumption that its route had been
2032,n01-057-06.jpg,through Florence and Rome and then
2033,n01-057-07.jpg,across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
2034,n01-057-08.jpg,It came to just over six hundred
2035,n01-057-09.jpg,miles .
2036,n02-004-00.jpg,"To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a"
2037,n02-004-01.jpg,vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
2038,n02-004-02.jpg,reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
2039,n02-004-03.jpg,But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
2040,n02-004-04.jpg,was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
2041,n02-004-05.jpg,"He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his"
2042,n02-004-06.jpg,"own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of"
2043,n02-004-07.jpg,asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
2044,n02-004-08.jpg,to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
2045,n02-009-00.jpg,""" I caught him just as he was going to the"
2046,n02-009-01.jpg,"airport to meet Blanche , "" he said . "" As a matter"
2047,n02-009-02.jpg,of fact I'd asked him last night to deputise
2048,n02-009-03.jpg,for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party
2049,n02-009-04.jpg,"too . They're both here . "" "" I didn't know she was"
2050,n02-009-05.jpg,"coming back from Barbados so soon . "" Beryl"
2051,n02-009-06.jpg,said the first thing that came into her head .
2052,n02-028-00.jpg,"Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to"
2053,n02-028-01.jpg,express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
2054,n02-028-02.jpg,"of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl"
2055,n02-028-03.jpg,"suggested having a second party , the following week , he"
2056,n02-028-04.jpg,"poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared ,"
2057,n02-028-05.jpg,"had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them"
2058,n02-028-06.jpg,nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile
2059,n02-028-07.jpg,Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
2060,n02-028-08.jpg,earned gratuity to his native village at the
2061,n02-028-09.jpg,north of the island .
2062,n02-033-00.jpg,It was all over and done with .
2063,n02-033-01.jpg,For the time being Beryl was content to let
2064,n02-033-02.jpg,"it go at that , but she resolved to have"
2065,n02-033-03.jpg,it out with Piers when a reasonable
2066,n02-033-04.jpg,opportunity presented itself . He must
2067,n02-033-05.jpg,learn that he could not treat her
2068,n02-033-06.jpg,"with injustice and contempt , ignoring"
2069,n02-033-07.jpg,her explanations as though he were
2070,n02-033-08.jpg,"a schoolmaster and she a small ,"
2071,n02-033-09.jpg,ignorant child .
2072,n02-037-00.jpg,He gave her no chance of any private
2073,n02-037-01.jpg,"conversation that evening , for when"
2074,n02-037-02.jpg,"Blanche and Jack left , he went with"
2075,n02-037-03.jpg,them . But next morning she insisted
2076,n02-037-04.jpg,on his taking her out in the jeep -
2077,n02-037-05.jpg,"to find , if possible , Hubert and his"
2078,n02-037-06.jpg,"relations , and tell them of"
2079,n02-037-07.jpg,her great disappointment at being
